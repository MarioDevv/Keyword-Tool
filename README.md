Welcome to KRT, a website that offers a range of powerful SEO tools designed to enhance your search engine optimization efforts. This README provides an overview of the website and its current features, as well as information about future updates.

### :spiral_notepad: Features

1. #### **Keyword Browser**
   
   - The Keyword Browser is a tool that utilizes a server with a pre-trained model from Gensim Python.
   - The model is specifically trained to extract topics and their corresponding keywords from a CSV file generated by Ahrefs.
   - Please note that this feature is currently under development and not yet functional.
2. #### **The Pixeler**
   
   - The Pixeler is an innovative tool that places us in the Google environment.
   - By providing a series of links, the Pixeler calculates the screen space that the corresponding text would occupy if it appeared on Google search results.
   - This tool functions similarly to the one offered by Mangools, providing valuable insights into pixel usage.
